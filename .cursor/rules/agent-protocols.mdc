# Agent Startup Protocols

- Always activate Serena MCP at the very beginning of every interaction/session; do not run commands before confirming activation.
- Log or otherwise note that Serena is active so subsequent steps can assume MCP context is ready.
- Skip manual formatting during iterative edits to save tokens and time; run `bun run lint:fix` before handing work off if formatting might be off.
