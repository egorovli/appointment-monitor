1) Determine active changes: use staged files if any, otherwise all changed files.

2) Analyze changes to understand their purpose.

3) Search open GitHub issues for relevance. A changeset may relate to multiple issues.

4) If no relevant issue exists, create one: brief title/description, assign to current user, use latest milestone if available, add appropriate labels.

5) Write commit message:
   - Conventional commits format
   - Concise, convey only what matters
   - Slightly passive-aggressive tone
   - Reference all relevant issues, e.g. "References #123, #234"

6) Execute `git commit` with the prepared message.
